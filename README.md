# Computer Vision Masterclass: GANs

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for the "Computer Vision Masterclass: GANs". The notebook is adapted from the TensorFlow tutorial on DCGANs, which can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/generative/dcgan).

## Description

This masterclass provides an in-depth guide to understanding and implementing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using TensorFlow. The notebook includes steps for importing necessary libraries, loading and pre-processing the dataset, building the generator and discriminator models, calculating the loss functions, and training the GAN model.

## Importing the Libraries

In this section, we import all the necessary libraries required for building and training the GAN model.

## Loading and Pre-processing the Dataset

This section covers the steps for loading the dataset and performing necessary pre-processing to prepare it for training the GAN.

## Building the Generator

Here, we define and build the generator model that will generate new data samples.

## Building the Discriminator

In this section, we define and build the discriminator model that will distinguish between real and generated data samples.

## Calculating the Loss

This section explains the loss functions used for training the generator and discriminator models.

## Training the Model

Here, we provide the steps for training the GAN model, including the training loop and monitoring the training process.

## Getting Started
